							<header><h2>Therapy</h2></header>
							<p>Feeling stuck in cycles of shame, fear, or self-doubt? If your past — especially experiences in faith-based or high-control environments — still shapes how you move through the world, you’re not alone. Many of my clients grapple with perfectionism, anxiety, and a deep sense of unworthiness that makes self-trust feel out of reach.</p>
							<p>I specialize in helping people heal from <strong>spiritual trauma, complicated grief, and internalized shame</strong>. Through <strong>EMDR, DBT, and Internal Family Systems (IFS)</strong>, I support clients in moving from judgment to compassion, from fear to clarity. Therapy here is about reclaiming your voice and building a life that fits you.</p>

							<h3>Areas of Focus</h3>
							<ul>
								<li><strong>Spiritual Trauma & Religious Deconstruction</strong> – Reclaiming autonomy and healing fear-based conditioning.</li>
								<li><strong>Grief & Loss</strong> – Support through death, disconnection, or the loss of identity or belief systems.</li>
								<li><strong>Shame & Perfectionism</strong> – Loosening the grip of internalized criticism and scarcity.</li>
								<li><strong>Addiction & Recovery</strong> – Working with the intersections of trauma, identity, and recovery.</li>
							</ul>

							<p>My rate is <strong>$200 per hour</strong>. I do not accept insurance, but I offer superbills and work with platforms like <a href="https://www.mentaya.com/" target="_blank">Mentaya</a> to help you access out-of-network reimbursement. If cost is a concern, we can explore options in your free consultation.</p>

							<header><h2>Clinical Supervision</h2></header>
							<p>As a <strong>Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Supervisor (LMFT-S)</strong>, I offer clinical supervision for associate therapists pursuing licensure in Texas.</p>
							<p>My approach is relational, equity-rooted, and designed to support emerging therapists in cultivating a voice that’s clinically sound and fully their own. Supervision is a space to explore complexity with safety and rigor.</p>
							<p>Supervision fees are discussed during an initial call and vary based on practice structure and experience level.</p>

							<header><h2>Speaking Engagements</h2></header>
							<p>I offer presentations on trauma recovery, systems of care, and the intersections of identity, ethics, and clinical work. My talks blend research, clinical application, and story — with warmth, clarity, and intention.</p>

							<h3>Popular Topics</h3>
