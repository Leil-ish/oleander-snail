											<p>Feeling stuck in cycles of shame, fear, or self-doubt? If your past experiences — especially in faith-based or high-control environments — still shape how you see yourself and the world, you’re not alone. Many of my clients struggle with perfectionism, anxiety, and a deep sense of unworthiness that makes it hard to trust themselves.</p>
											<p>I specialize in helping individuals heal from spiritual trauma, complicated grief, and the wounds of rigid belief systems. Using a blend of <strong>EMDR, DBT, and Internal Family Systems (IFS)</strong>, I help clients move from self-judgment to self-compassion, from fear to self-trust. Therapy is a space where you can untangle old narratives, rediscover your voice, and build a life that feels like yours.</p>
											
											<h3>Areas of Focus:</h3>
											<ul>
												<li><strong>Spiritual Trauma & Religious Deconstruction</strong> – Healing from fear-based belief systems and reclaiming your autonomy.</li>
												<li><strong>Grief & Loss</strong> – Navigating the pain of loss, whether it’s a loved one, a belief system, or a former sense of self.</li>
												<li><strong>Shame & Perfectionism</strong> – Breaking free from internalized self-criticism and learning to live with self-trust.</li>
												<li><strong>Addiction & Recovery</strong> – Support for those navigating substance use, often intertwined with identity, faith, and family dynamics.</li>
											</ul>

											<p>My rate is $200 per hour, and I do not accept insurance. However, I believe that finances should never be the sole barrier to accessing therapy, especially for clients who are a strong fit for my services. If cost is a concern, I’m always happy to discuss options during a free consultation call. I can provide superbills for clients seeking reimbursement through their insurance and can also work with services like Mentaya to help navigate out-of-network therapy coverage. My goal is to ensure that you receive the support you need in a way that works for you.

											<h2> </h2>
										</header>
											<p>As a <strong>Licensed Marriage and Family Therapist Supervisor (LMFT-S)</strong>, I provide clinical supervision for associate therapists seeking licensure in Texas. Supervision isn’t just about meeting requirements — it’s about finding the approach that feels most uniquely "you" and implementing it in an ethical, dynamic, and fulfilling way.</p>
											<p>I take a relational, insight-driven approach to supervision, helping new therapists develop their clinical voice while ensuring they feel supported in the challenging work of holding space for others. If you want to grow as a trauma-informed, socially aware clinician, I’d love to support your journey.</p>
											<p>Fees for supervision are generally paid monthly and are determined on a case-by-case basis depending on practice location and experience level.</p>
