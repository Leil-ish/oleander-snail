          <p>
            You’re highly self-aware. You’ve analyzed your past, you understand
            your "why," and you can explain your patterns to anyone who asks.
            But understanding it hasn't changed it.
          </p>

          <p>
            You’re still exhausted. You’re still over-functioning. You’re still
            waiting for the other shoe to drop because you’ve built a life based
            on who you were told to be, not who you actually are.
          </p>

          <p>
            Success shouldn’t feel this heavy. If intellect alone could fix
            this, you’d have solved it years ago. I offer a space where you can
            stop analyzing your life and start living it.

          <h3>Therapy</h3>
          <p>
            I specialize in the things high-achievers tend to bury: religious
            trauma, the "never-enough" cycle of perfectionism, and the specific
            kind of grief that comes with outgrowing your environment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>The Tools:</strong> Parts work, challenging old assumptions,
            and picking up new skills. We use these to reset your nervous system
            so your body finally believes what your mind already knows.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Fee:</strong> $200/hour. Out-of-network reimbursement via
            superbill or automated with Mentaya or Thrizer.
          </p>

          <h3>Supervision & Consulting</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>For Clinicians:</strong> Relational supervision for LMFT
            Associates who want to develop their own clinical authority rather
            than just checking boxes.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>For Organizations:</strong> Strategic consulting to build
            cultures that don't rely on burnout as a feature.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m Leila Anderson, LMFT-S. I’m a therapist, supervisor, and
            consultant, but more importantly, I’m someone who knows what it’s
            like to untangle a life from systems — religious, family, and
            corporate —that reward shrinking.
          </p>

          <p>
            I don't do "small talk" therapy. I bring over a decade of experience
            and a sharp lens on how power, culture, and systems shape who we
            are.
          </p>

          <h3 class="major">Framework & Alignment</h3>
          <p>
            I don't believe therapy is a neutral act. My work is intentionally
            informed by the following lenses:
          </p>
          <ul style="font-size: 0.9em; list-style-type: none; padding-left: 0">
            <li>
              <strong>Anti-Racist & Decolonial:</strong> Naming how systemic
              oppression and white supremacy impact your mental health.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>LGBTQ+ & TGNC Affirming:</strong> Centering autonomy and
              celebration, not just tolerance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Fat Positive / HAES:</strong> Rejecting weight stigma and
              the pathologization of body size.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Neuro-Affirming:</strong> Moving away from "masking" and
              toward honoring divergent brains.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Relational & Justice-Oriented:</strong> Recognizing that
              your "symptoms" often make perfect sense in the context of your
              environment.

          </p>
          <p>
            Under the law, health care providers need to give patients who don’t
            have insurance or who are not using insurance an estimate of the
            bill for medical items and services.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              You have the right to receive a Good Faith Estimate for the total
              expected cost of any non-emergency items or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure your health care provider gives you a Good Faith
              Estimate in writing at least 1 business day before your medical
              service or item.
            </li>
            <li>
              If you receive a bill that is at least $400 more than your Good
              Faith Estimate, you can dispute the bill.
            </li>
            <li>
              Make sure to save a copy or picture of your Good Faith Estimate.
