								<span class="image main"><img src="images/banner.jpg" alt="Austin, TX skyline from a graffiti park." /></span>
								<p>Welcome to <strong>Oleander Counseling & Consulting</strong>, where depth meets healing and high-achievers stop playing small to finally take up the space they deserve.</p>
								<p><strong>Hey, You. I See You.</strong></p>
								<p>You're self-aware, driven, and perhaps, deeply exhausted. You've navigated complex systems—family, faith, culture—that tried to define or diminish you. Your high-functioning exterior often masks cycles of self-criticism and overfunctioning, leaving you feeling disconnected from your true self. You crave a therapeutic space that honors your intellect and your emotional world, and you're tired of quick fixes. You're ready for a depth-oriented approach to live in alignment with your values.</p>
                                <p>You've achieved so much, yet a quiet fear whispers you're not truly safe in your success.</p>
                                <p>You find yourself constantly overfunctioning, exhausting yourself to outrun a deeply ingrained sense of "not enough."</p>
                                <p>You're tired of surface-level solutions. You crave a space where your intellect, your pain, and your ambition are all equally welcome.</p>
                                <p>You've been taught to shrink your truth, to soften your power, and now you're wondering what it's costing you to stay "palatable."</p>
                                <p>The systems you've navigated have left their mark, and you're seeking a path to healing that truly honors your lived experience, not just labels it.</p>
                                <p>You're deeply self-aware, highly capable, and perhaps, profoundly exhausted by the constant pressure to perform and prove.</p>
                                <p>You're ready to heal from past wounds, but you need a guide who understands the unique complexities of spiritual trauma or systemic pressures without judgment or platitudes.</p>

								<h2 class="major">Hi, I’m Leila Anderson, LMFT-S.</h2>
								<span class="image main"><img src="images/headshot.jpg" alt="Headshot of Leila Anderson, LMFT-S" /></span>

                                <p>Think of me as your trusted guide for un-shrinking your life and leadership. I'm a therapist, supervisor, consultant, and speaker fiercely rooted in justice and powered by presence. I'm here to help you shed what no longer serves you and truly come home to your most authentic, powerful self. You're not broken. You make profound sense—and it's time you fully owned that truth.</p>
                                <p>My dedication to this work isn't just professional; it's deeply personal. I was raised in religious spaces filled with both love and unspoken fear. That experience profoundly shaped my passion for helping others untangle old beliefs and build a life led by curiosity, nuance, and self-trust.</p>

                                <h3>Where Clinical Expertise Meets Lived Wisdom</h3>
                                <p>I bring over a decade of experience across diverse clinical, academic, and leadership settings. My education includes an M.A. in Marriage and Family Therapy from Abilene Christian University and a B.A. in Psycholinguistics from Harding University.</p>
                                <p>Beyond credentials, my approach is distinct: I blend rigorous clinical knowledge (EMDR, DBT, IFS) with a deeply relational, shame-reducing stance. I'm not afraid to name systems—family systems, cultural systems, colonial systems—and help you see how they've shaped you. My past roles, including Owner of Oleander Counseling and Consulting, Clinical Strategist at Lucent Recovery and Wellness, and Executive Clinical Director at Ava Recovery Center, among others, have given me a unique perspective. I'm also a proud Board Member of the Texas Association for MFT and a presenter at various professional conferences. I draw on lived experience across cultures, faith traditions, and roles (mother, clinician, advocate), which helps me hold complexity without collapsing into binaries.</p>
                                <p>For a complete overview of my qualifications and experience, please <a href="/assets/files/Leila_Anderson_2025_CV.pdf" download>download my full CV (PDF)</a>.</p>
