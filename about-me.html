							<h3>About Me</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I’m a licensed marriage and family therapist and clinical supervisor with over a decade of experience supporting people through trauma, grief, and the deep work of reclaiming their lives. I specialize in helping clients unlearn shame, unpack spiritual trauma, and reconnect with the parts of themselves they’ve had to hide to survive.
						</p>
						<p>
							I came to this work not just through clinical training, but through lived experience. I was raised in religious spaces shaped by both deep care and unspoken fear. I know what it is to internalize messages that keep you small — and how hard it can be to disentangle identity from expectation. That’s why I offer therapy that doesn’t pathologize or oversimplify. Instead, I work with you to honor your survival strategies, reconnect with your inner wisdom, and build something more spacious and sustainable.
						</p>
						<p>
							My approach blends evidence-based models (EMDR, DBT, IFS) with a relational, system-aware lens. I believe therapy should make space for curiosity, contradiction, and wholeness — not just symptom relief. My practice is LGBTQIA+ affirming, trauma-informed, and rooted in Health at Every Size (HAES) principles. All bodies and identities are welcome here.
						</p>
						<p>
							Outside of my clinical work, I offer training and consultation for professionals, practices, and programs seeking to integrate justice-aligned care with clinical depth. Whether I’m speaking on spiritual trauma, curriculum design, or supervision ethics, I bring both strategic insight and deep heart to the table.
						</p>
						<p>
							When I’m off the clock, I’m a mom of three, a gardener, a former barista with a strong Chemex preference (Ethiopian roast is a classic for a reason), and always game for a hiking trail or a thoughtful conversation over good coffee.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you’re here because something in your story needs more room — or you’re looking for support that respects your full complexity — I’d love to connect.
						</p>
